# Data Output

The web scraper will create a folder here titled 'amazon' once you run the amazon spider. Inside, there will be a .json file for each computer component. Each of these files have a common name template: amazon_[COMPUTERPART].json. For the other spiders, it's the same process.

## Feel free to modify this behavior in the pipelines file.
